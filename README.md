## Fundamentals of Deep Learning

### The *Deep* in **Deep Learning**

It isn't a reference to any kind of deeper understanding achieved by any kind of deeper understanding of meaningful understanding;
achieved by any approach rather, stands for the idea of successful representation of layers.

How many layer contribute to a model of data is *layers*.
Approaches to to machine learning tend to focus on learning only one or two layers of the representations of the data: **shallow learning**.
